pLinkedArray

For this assignment we were supposed to extend the code Dr.Ladd gave us to have an array of linked lists.
These linked lists were supposed to be able to be added to, emptied, removed from, and combined. This assignment left
me very confused and stressed which is why it's an unfinished mess. My hope is that I will be able to look back at this
in the future and realize what I was supposed to do.
